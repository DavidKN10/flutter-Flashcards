## Summary and Reflection

I tried to separate each screen to a separate dart file. In addition, I created a some classes to easily manage data. I had some trouble implementing the sorting. You can sort the cards when you are on the card screen. However, when you start the quiz, the cards are in the order that they were when the deck was created. Also, when you start eh app, the three decks that were on the JSON file are added to the deck list even if they are already in there. 

This machine problem was somewhat enjoyable. Definitely the toughest one so far. I disliked implementing the database since that took the longest time and was tedious. Not hard, just time consuming.
